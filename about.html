      We launched Forward Loop to build internet-connected sensors for real-world applications.<br>
      <br>
      We build, assemble, and test hardware, software, and networking solutions for many different applications. 
      In order to support our products, we provide open-source 
      tools that we use to prototype and develop applications.
      Our goal is to provide sensors that allow you to scale from prototype to MVP to 
      large deployments using the same hardware and development tools the whole time.<br><br>
      We want enterprises, developers, and enthusiasts to use tools they are comfortable with to make products they understand.
